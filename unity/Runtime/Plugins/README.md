## User MuJoCo Plugins

MuJoCo physics functionality can be extended with user plugins. For more information, see the [documentation ](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programming/extension.html#explugin). Place plugin libraries in this folder to load them when importing or running a model with user plugins.

User plugin support for the Unity package is currently experimental, consider comparing results with simulations outside of Unity.
